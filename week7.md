# Week 7
## Task: Create a Second Version of your MEI File with the Updated Metadata. Add a Genre Classification. Add Specific Licensing Data.
Here is my updated MEI file containing the additional metadata: [Updated MEI File](SatisfiedTestXML7INFO.mei)
## Task: Discuss why you have made the Choice you made.
I chose the Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike licence so that others have the freedom to share and collaborate the work, however credit is still required. It is also non-profit, meaning no money can be made from the project as it is intended for academic use within the university. 
## Task: Render your Revised MEI Metadata along with your Score on an HTML Page. 
Here is the MEI file including its Metadata, on an html page: [Updated MEI HTML File](metaRAW.html)
