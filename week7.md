# Week 7
## Task: Create a Second Version of your MEI File with the Updated Metadata. Add a Genre Classification. Add Specific Licensing Data.
Here is my updated MEI file containing the additional metadata: [Updated MEI File](SatisfiedTestXML7INFO.mei)
## Task: Discuss why you have made the Choice you made.
I chose the Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike licence so that others have the freedom to share and collaborate on the project, however credit is still required. It is also a non-profit licence, meaning no money can be made from the project as it is intended for academic use within the university. 
## Task: Render your Revised MEI Metadata along with your Score on an HTML Page. 
Here is the MEI file including its Metadata, on an html page: [Updated MEI HTML File](metaRAW.html)
## Task: Discuss how you would Format the Metadata to make it look Nicer.
The utilisation of lists, headings and grouping the data into categories (for example, title, artist, and publisher could appear in succession) would make the metadata more organised and structured.
