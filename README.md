## Task: Identify a Dataset Theme

The theme I have chosen for this dataset is the musical 'Hamilton'. First performed in 2015, Lin-Manual Miranda's biographical-style musical illustrates the life of American founding father, Alexander Hamilton through the use of musical genres such as rap and singing. This portfolio will focus primarily on the song 'Satisfied' - sung originally by Ren√©e Elise Goldsberry, who plays Angelica Schuyler.

## Task: Identify Challenges to Working with Music and Music-Related Data

A common challenge with accessing and curating music-related data is copyright. Copyright protects creators from unmonitored distribution of their work. This can be a challenge for those working with music as it can be costly to obtain and access the required data. For example, although I was able to find multiple copies of the instrumental parts on websites such as SheetMusic-Free.com, it was quite difficult for me to find a copy of the Satisfied sheet music which included both the vocal and instrumental components, and didn't fail to comply with the laws of copyright. I eventually found the first page available on MuseScore and Music Notes, free of charge. 

Another challenge is the digital medium of most music-related data. In terms of accessibility and distribution, it can often be difficult to create a piece which can be accessed in every digital format. For examlpe, when transposing a piece, MuseScore is an effective software, however not all digital programmes can be imported into MuseScore. PDF is one of the most successful file types for MuseScore transferring, however there are often issues relating to cost (a lot of conversion softwares are not available for free), accuracy (the software often cannot recognise and translate every aspect of a piece accurately) and time (time required to edit the innacuratly-read data, or time required for the file to convert) when attempting to convert a file to a PDF.

There are multiple factors to consider when creating a piece such as rhythm, tempo, key, timbre and volume. With such large-scale productions like Hamilton, it can be incredibly difficult to coordinate all of these elements with such a large amount of instruments and vocals.

## Task: Identify the Current Manifestations of Related Data

### Notated Data

There were several versions of Satisfied written by others members of the public available for use on websites such as Tumblr and Pinterest. The first page of the original version of the song were also available on websites such as MuseScore and Music Notes.

### Acoustic Data

I was able to access both the original scores and the instrumental versions of Hamilton on Spotify and Youtube, however they are also available on multiple other popular streaming platforms including Amazon Music and Apple Music. A plethora of covers can be found online as well - both vocal and instrumental. Frequent live performances of the production are also available to attend, with casts located in New York, North America, London, Australia and UK & Ireland (according to the Hamilton official website).

### Descriptive Data

The Hamilton official website does not contain any descriptive data about the song, however Spotify contains the:
- Song title (Satisfied)
- Album title (Hamilton Original Broadway Cast Recording)
- Artist (Renee Elise Goldsberry)
- Composer (Lin-Manuel Miranda)
- Producers (Alex Lacamoire, Bill Sherman, TarikTrotter)
- Song duration (5 minutes, 29 seconds)
- Release date (2015)
- Record company (Atlantic Records)

This is the case for all the songs in the production, and this descriptive data can also be found on Apple Music and Youtube. there are also many websites in which people analsye the music and lyrics in immesne detail - OnStage Blog, for example. Youtube also contains video essays covering an analysis of the song.
