# DMIS Music Curation and Analytics Portfolio
Week 1: 
Task: Identify a Dataset Theme
The theme I have chosen for this dataset is the musical 'Hamilton'. First performed in 2015, Lin-Manual Miranda's biographical-style musical illustrates the life of American founding father, Alexander Hamilton through the use of musical genres such as rap and singing. This portfolio will focus primarily on the song 'Satisfied' - sung originally by Ren√©e Elise Goldsberry, who plays Angelica Schuyler.

Task: Challenges to Working with Music and Music-Related Data
A common challenge when working with music-related data is copyright. Copyright protects creators from unmonitored distribution of their work. This can be a challenge for those working with music as it can be costly to obtain to required data.
