# DMIS Music Curation and Analytics Portfolio
Week 1
  
Task: Identify a Dataset Theme

The theme I have chosen for this dataset is the musical 'Hamilton'. First performed in 2015, Lin-Manual Miranda's biographical-style musical illustrates the life of American founding father, Alexander Hamilton through the use of musical genres such as rap and singing. This portfolio will focus primarily on the song 'Satisfied' - sung originally by Ren√©e Elise Goldsberry, who plays Angelica Schuyler.

Task: Identify Challenges to Working with Music and Music-Related Data

A common challenge when working with music-related data is copyright. Copyright protects creators from unmonitored distribution of their work. This can be a challenge for those working with music as it can be costly to obtain and access the required data. For example, although I was able to find multiple copies of the instrumental parts on websites such as SheetMusic-Free.com, it was quite difficult for me to find a copy of the Satisfied sheet music which included both the voice and instrumental components which was free of copyright. I eventually found the first page available on MuseScore and Music Notes, free of charge.
