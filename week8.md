## Task: Describe at Least One Advantage of a Time-Frequency Analysis over a Waveform-Based Analysis. Provide at Least One Example of the Identified Advantage by Referencing a Specific Subpart of the Output from Step 1.
Waveform based analysis provides us with various types of information regarding the amplitude, magnitude, energy and shape of the music – which allows us to determine the dynamics present within the piece (the peaks and troughs depict the volume), as well as a basic display of the rhythm. However, this data is not the most effective when attempting to visually analyse music as it does not contain any numerical information. Time-frequency analysis such as spectrograms on the other hand, allows us to determine the notes and precise frequencies (and how they change throughout the piece), as well as locating areas of high or low density and intensity. An advantage of using time-frequency analysis is the ability to utilise the numerical data available, in order to understand the precise frequencies within a piece, which is more difficult to comprehend in a waveform-based analysis. For example, in regards to Brittany J Smith’s cover of Satisfied, the spectrogram offers a detailed depiction of the melodical and temporal elements of the piece, as well as the duration and pitch of the notes, which conversely, are not as clear in the waveform analysis.
