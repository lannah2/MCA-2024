# Week 10
## Task: Generate a similarity matrix
To generate a similarity matrix, I have used the same three pieces from last week's task as I found that they were the most relevant to my theme:

## Task: Open your Piece of Music from Week 2 in MuseScore. Export it as a WAV File and as an Image File, and open the WAV File in SonicVisualizer. Perform a Polyphonic Transcription on the File. Open the MIDI file in MuseScore and Export it as an image. In your Portfolio, Display both Images.

### 1. Original Piece:

### 2. Transcribed Piece:

## Task: Compare the Transcription with the Original, Reflecting on its Accuracy and Identifying any Information that has been Lost.

Upon first look at the two scores, the first notable dissimilarity, is the difference in the two time signatures. The original piece is in cut time, whilst the transcribed version is in common time. Secondly, the duration of the notes and rests are very different, and every chord in the base line appears to be different – this is due to the fact that the majority of the melody has been transcribed in the bass clef. Because of this line 4 displays the most visual difference between the notes, however surprisingly, is doesn’t sound as different from the original as I had imagined. The pitch is higher, as if the piece had been transposed, but the overall tune and essence of the piece is quite similar – making it recognisable as a ‘version’ of the original song.
