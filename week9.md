## Task: For Either the MFCC or Chroma Feature, Compare the Histograms for the 3 Tracks.
For this task, I chose three covers of Satisfied from Hamilton – the first was a voice cover with the original backing track, the second was an acoustic guitar cover, and the third was a multiple-part a cappella cover. Therefore, there was an expectation that each piece would be presented differently on the histograms. For this analysis, I will be looking specifically at the MFCC histograms. Due to the instrumental elements in the first and second pieces, when listening to the tracks I expected these two to be more similar than the third piece, which contains only vocal elements (MFCCs tend to analyse timbre). This is evident when looking at the MFCC histograms – I can see that the frequencies are more similar between pieces 1 and 2, whilst piece three has a much smaller frequency. Despite this, there are still noticeable differences between the first and second pieces, perhaps due to the difference in genre. Piece 1 is significantly more upbeat and tends to follow the rules of musical theatre, whereas piece 2 adopts a more sombre tone, containing some characteristics or indie/pop.
