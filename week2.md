# Week 2

## Task: Transcribe a Piece of Music from the Dataset you Selected Last Week to MuseScore

As mentioned previously, I have selected the song Satisfied from the musical Hamilton. The transposed version is available for download here: [Satisfied MuseScore File](SatisfiedMuseScore.mscz)

For comparison, the unedited version is available for download here: [Satisfied Unedited MuseScore File](SatisfiedUnedited.mscz)

Here is the original PDF version: [Satisfied Original PDF](SatisfiedPDF.pdf)

## Task: Discuss the Aspects of your Score That Were not Transcribed Properly

### Accuracies 

- MuseScore successfully transcribed the key signature and the clefs of each staff.
- For the majority of the piece, the pitch and rhythm are fairly accurate.
- The software correctly identifies the timbre of the piece - piano and voice.

### Inaccuracies

- MuseScore did not manage to transcribe the time signature of cut time (2/2) - in fact, no time signature was added.
- The lyrics were not recognised either and therefore not included in the the transcription.
- The tempo of the original composition is 'minum=62', however the transcribed version is 'crotchet=120'.
- The prgramme failed almost entirely to comprehend the bass clef of the piano element, only capturing 7 notes - 3 of which were accurate.
- The bar which contains the introduction of the lyrical component, was completely incorrect, however, the correct rhythm and pitch does return to accuracy immediately after this.
- The ties were relatively accurate, however they were often skipped on chords.
- The number of bars is significantly different to the original.

These errors may be due to the quality of the pdf, or the integrity of the software in its understanding of musical notation.
