# Week 2

## Task: Transcribe a Piece of Music from the Dataset you Selected Last Week to MuseScore

As mentioned previously, I have selected the song Satisfied from the musical Hamilton. The transposed version is available for download here: [Satisfied MuseScore File](SatisfiedMuseScore.mscz)

For comparison, the unedited version is available for download here: [Satisfied Unedited MuseScore File](SatisfiedUnedited.mscz)

### PDF Image of the Transposed Version:

## Task: Discuss the Aspects of your Score That Were not Transcribed Properly

- MuseScore did not manage to transcribe the time signature of cut time (2/2) - in fact, no time signature was added.
- The lyrics were not recognised either and therefore not included in the the transcription.
- The prgramme failed almost entirely to comprehend the bass clef of the piano element, only capturing 7 notes - 3 of which were accurate.
- The bar which contains the introduction of the lyrical component, was completely incorrect, however, the correct rhythm does return immediately after this.

The bars are smaller and therefore there are more of them

Not all ties/slurs could be added accurately

Completely wrong rhythms 

These errors may be due to the quality of the pdf, or the integrity of the software in its understanding of musical notation.
