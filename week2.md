## Task: transcribe a Piece of Music from the Dataset you Selected Last Week to MuseScore

[Satisfied MuseScore](SatisfiedMuseScore.mscz)

### AN image of the transposed version can be found here:

Not all ties/slurs could be added accurately

Completely wrong rhythms 

Possibly due to the quality of the pdf
