# Week 2

## Task: Transcribe Chosen Piece in MuseScore 

### Here is a copy of my transposed version of Satisfied: 

[Satisfied MuseScore](SatisfiedMuseScore.mscz)

Didnâ€™t get the time signature of cut time

The bars are smaller and therefore there are more of them

Not all ties/slurs could be added accurately

Completely wrong rhythms 

Possibly due to the quality of the pdf
