# Week 2

## Task: Transcribe a Piece of Music from the Dataset you Selected Last Week to MuseScore

As mentioned previously, I have selected the song Satisfied from the musical Hamilton. The transposed version is available for download here: [Satisfied MuseScore File](SatisfiedMuseScore.mscz)

For comparison, the unedited version is available for download here: 

### PDF Image of the Transposed Version:

## Task: Discuss the Aspects of your Score That Were not Transcribed Properly

Didnâ€™t get the time signature of cut time

The bars are smaller and therefore there are more of them

Not all ties/slurs could be added accurately

Completely wrong rhythms 

Possibly due to the quality of the pdf
